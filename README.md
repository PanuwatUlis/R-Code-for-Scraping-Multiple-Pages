Scraping data from the web browser multiple taps

In the mudleyworld web brownser, I need to extract trander ranking 1-80 and score and EDA with boxplot to find outlier 
The data is in many taps so  I use lapply function to do loop to extract data from tap#1 to tap#2 and then use abind library
to combine data together and make them to be dataframe. After that create boxplot to see outlier and save picture as png formant

Important Libraries
>rverse library

>tidyverse library

>abind library

>gridExtra library

If you do not have any library, install it before start run the code
